-- SPAN OF SERVICE
-- Returns the time in seconds of the first/last departure; note that the last departure may actually be an arrival if its a terminal stop. Hours of service is different. Some post-processing should be done on rows with early_departures=true because that means thereâ€™s a departure before 4:30 AM which is a rough indicator of some kind of late-night service.
